\usage{
getVideoMetadata(
  video.folders,
  video.format = "mp4",
  id.metadata = NULL,
  id.col = "ID",
  tagdate.col = "tagging_date"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{video.folders}{Character vector. Paths to directories containing video files.}

\item{video.format}{Character vector. Allowed video formats, such as "mp4" or "mov". Defaults to "mp4".}

\item{id.metadata}{Optional. Data frame containing metadata about the videos. Must include columns for
identifying IDs (\code{id.col}) and tagging dates (\code{tagdate.col}). If provided, the tagging date is used to
determine the start time of the video.}

\item{id.col}{Character string. Column name in \code{id.metadata} corresponding to folder IDs. Defaults to "ID".}

\item{tagdate.col}{Character string. Column name in \code{id.metadata} with tagging dates. Defaults to "tagging_date".}
}
\value{
A data frame containing metadata for each video file, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{ID}: Folder identifier (if \code{id.metadata} is provided).
\item \code{video}: Video filename.
\item \code{start}: Start time of the video (POSIXct).
\item \code{end}: End time of the video (POSIXct).
\item \code{duration}: Video duration in seconds.
\item \code{frame_rate}: Frame rate in frames per second.
\item \code{file}: Full path to the video file.
}
}
\description{
This function extracts metadata from video files within specified directories. The metadata includes
start time, end time, duration, and frame rate. The start time is derived using Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) on the first frame of each video. If \code{id.metadata} is supplied, the start time will
be assumed to match the tagging date of the animal, and only the time portion will be extracted using OCR.
This approach increases the reliability of the time extraction by using the known tagging date as a reference.
However, note that OCR is not perfect, and its accuracy may vary from video to video.
