\arguments{
\item{data}{A list of data.tables/data.frames, one for each individual; a single aggregated data.table/data.frame
containing data from multiple animals (with an 'ID' column); or a character vector of file paths pointing to
\code{.rds} files, each containing data for a single individual. When a character vector is provided,
files are loaded sequentially to optimize memory use. The output of the \link{importTagData} function
is strongly recommended, as it formats the data appropriately for all downstream analysis.}

\item{downsample.to}{Numeric. Downsampling frequency in Hz (e.g., 1 for 1 Hz) to reduce data resolution.
Use NULL to retain the original resolution. Defaults to 1.}

\item{hard.iron.calibration}{Logical. Whether to apply hard-iron calibration (offset correction) to magnetometer data.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{soft.iron.calibration}{Logical. Whether to apply soft-iron calibration (scaling and misalignment correction) to magnetometer data.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{orientation.algorithm}{Orientation estimation algorithm:
\itemize{
\item \code{"tilt_compass"} (default): Lightweight 6-axis tilt-compensated compass.

}}

\item{madgwick.beta}{Numeric. The Madgwick filter's gain parameter (default: 0.02).
This parameter controls the trade-off between gyroscope and accelerometer measurements.
\itemize{
\item Higher values (e.g., 0.2-0.3) trust the accelerometer more, leading to faster convergence but potentially more noise
.    \item Lower values (e.g., 0.01-0.05) trust the gyroscope more, resulting in smoother but potentially slower convergence
}
Only used when \code{orientation.algorithm = "madgwick"}.}

Uses circular mean. Set to NULL to disable. Default: 1.}

\item{speed.calibration.values}{A data.frame containing paddle wheel calibration values for speed estimation.
Must contain at least three columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{year}: The year the calibration was performed (integer)
\item \code{package_id}: The package identifier matching the tag's attribute (character)
\item \code{slope}: The calibration slope value (numeric)
}
This parameter is only used when \code{calculate.paddle.speed = TRUE}. Default is NULL.}

\item{burst.quantiles}{Numeric vector. Quantiles (0-1) to define burst swimming events based on acceleration thresholds.
Use NULL to disable burst detection. Defaults to c(0.95, 0.99) (95th and 99th percentiles).}

\item{return.data}{Logical. Controls whether the function returns the processed data
as a list in memory. When processing large or numerous datasets, set to \code{FALSE} to reduce
memory usage. Note that either \code{return.data} or \code{save.files} must be \code{TRUE}
(or both). Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{save.files}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the processed data for each ID will be saved as RDS files

This parameter is only used if \code{save.files = TRUE}.}

\item{data.table.threads}{Integer or NULL. Specifies the number of threads
that data.table should use for parallelized operations. NULL (default): Uses data.table's current default threading.
Notes:
\itemize{
\item Optimal thread count depends on your CPU cores and data size
\item More threads use more RAM but can significantly speed up large operations
\item Can be permanently set via \code{data.table::setDTthreads()}
\item Current thread count: \code{data.table::getDTthreads()}
}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, the function will print detailed processing information. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
If \code{return.data = TRUE}, returns a list where each element contains the
processed sensor data for an individual folder. If \code{return.data = FALSE},
returns \code{NULL} invisibly. In all cases, data will be saved to disk if
\code{save.files = TRUE}.

\description{
This function processes high-resolution archival tag data, automatically computing a
wide range of kinematic and orientation metrics from accelerometer, magnetometer,
and gyroscope signals (see the \emph{Details} section below for a complete list).

Orientation is estimated by default using the tilt-compensated compass method, which fuses accelerometer
and magnetometer data to determine body orientation relative to gravity and magnetic north.
Optionally, a more advanced sensor fusion approach using the Madgwick filter can be applied.

A full 3D magnetic calibration can be applied prior to orientation estimation, including both
hard iron (offset) and soft iron (scaling and misalignment) corrections.

For tags equipped with a magnetic paddle wheel, the function can also estimate swimming speed.
This is achieved by extracting the dominant rotation frequency from the magnetometer's
z-axis signal using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is then converted
to speed using a tag-specific calibration slope

After metric computation, the data can be downsampled to reduce its resolution and
size for downstream analysis.

Note: Python and the associated libraries \code{AHRS} and \code{numpy} (accessible via \code{reticulate}) are required
if orientation is estimated using the Madgwick filter.
}
\details{
This function computes a suite of movement and orientation metrics from high-frequency tri-axial sensor data,
including acceleration, orientation, and linear motion parameters. It also performs automatic magnetic calibration
to improve heading estimation.

\strong{Acceleration:}
\itemize{
\item Total Acceleration (g): The total magnitude of the animal's acceleration, calculated from the three orthogonal accelerometer components.
\item Vectorial Dynamic Body Acceleration (VeDBA) (g): Quantifies the physical acceleration of the animal, calculated as the vector magnitude of the dynamic body acceleration, which is the difference between raw accelerometer data and the moving average (static acceleration).
\item Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration (ODBA) (g): A scalar measure of the animal's overall acceleration, calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the dynamic acceleration components along the X, Y, and Z axes.
\item Burst Swimming Events: Identifies periods of high acceleration based on a given acceleration magnitude percentile, which can be used to detect burst swimming behavior. This metric is binary, indicating whether the acceleration exceeds the threshold.
}

\strong{Orientation:}

Computed using sensor fusion algorithms:
\itemize{
\item {Tilt-compensated compass} (default): A lightweight 6-axis fusion (accelerometer + magnetometer)
to compute roll, pitch, and heading. The method first calculates tilt angles from accelerometer data,
then compensates the magnetometer readings using these angles to compute a more accurate heading.
This approach avoids gyroscope drift but may be affected by magnetic disturbances.
\item {Madgwick filter}: A 9-axis fusion algorithm (accelerometer + gyroscope + magnetometer)
implementing Sebastian Madgwick's quaternion-based gradient descent
approach. This provides absolute orientation reference by incorporating
Earth's magnetic field and is more robust to transient disturbances,
at the cost of higher computational complexity.
}
Output includes:
\itemize{
\item Roll (degrees): Rotational movement of the animal around its longitudinal (x) axis.
\item Pitch (degrees): Rotational movement of the animal around its lateral (y) axis.
\item Heading (degrees): Directional orientation of the animal, representing the compass heading.
Heading is corrected based on the deployment coordinates using global geomagnetic declination models.
}

\strong{Linear Motion:}
\itemize{
\item Surge (g): The forward-backward linear movement of the animal along its body axis, derived from the accelerometer data.
\item Sway (g): The side-to-side linear movement along the lateral axis of the animal, also derived from the accelerometer data.
\item Heave (g): The vertical linear movement of the animal along the vertical axis, estimated from accelerometer data.
\item Vertical Speed (m/s): The vertical velocity of the animal, representing the speed at which the animal is moving vertically in the water column.
Calculated as the difference in depth measurements divided by the time interval
}

\strong{Python Requirements}
\itemize{
\item Requires the \code{reticulate} R package for interfacing with Python.
\item The active Python environment must include the \code{AHRS} and \code{numpy} modules.
\item If unavailable, the function will return an informative error with installation guidance.
