\title{Identify and Handle Temporal Discontinuities in Time Series Data}
\usage{
checkTimeGaps(
  data,
  datetime.col = "datetime",
  pre.deploy.threshold = 0.2,
  post.deploy.threshold = 0.8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing a column with datetime information. The column should be of class \code{POSIXt}}

\item{datetime.col}{A character string specifying the name of the column containing the datetime values. Default is \code{"datetime"}.}

\item{pre.deploy.threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1, indicating the threshold (as a percentage) for the start of the deployment period.
Data before this percentage will be considered as pre-deployment. Default is 0.2 (20\%).}

\item{post.deploy.threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1, indicating the threshold (as a percentage) for the end of the deployment period.
Data after this percentage will be considered as post-deployment. Default is 0.8 (80\%).}
}
\value{
A data frame (\code{data}) with rows before or after the detected temporal discontinuities removed, based on the thresholds specified.
If the gap is detected within the specified range (before or after the deployment), the corresponding data will be retained.

A data frame (\code{data}) with rows before or after the detected temporal discontinuities removed.
}
\description{
This function checks for temporal discontinuities in a specified datetime column of a dataset.
It automatically infers the sampling interval by identifying the most frequent time difference between
consecutive timestamps and reports it to the user. Detected gaps larger than this interval are flagged
as anomalies, and rows corresponding to these gaps are discarded based on their position relative to
the defined pre-deployment and post-deployment periods.
