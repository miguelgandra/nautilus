\usage{
checkTimeGaps(
  data,
  id.col = "ID",
  datetime.col = "datetime",
  time.diff.threshold = 0.001,
  early.threshold = 0.2,
  late.threshold = 0.8,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or data table containing a column with datetime information. The column should be of class POSIXt.}

\item{id.col}{A string representing the column name for the ID field (default is "ID").}

\item{datetime.col}{A character string specifying the name of the column containing the datetime values. Default is \code{"datetime"}.}

\item{time.diff.threshold}{A numeric value specifying the maximum allowable difference
between consecutive time differences to be considered within the expected sampling interval.
Any time differences exceeding this threshold will be flagged as outliers, even if they are
close to the most frequent sampling interval. This helps account for small fluctuations or
inaccuracies in timestamps due to floating-point rounding. If set to \code{NULL}, no
additional threshold is applied beyond the inferred sampling interval. Defaults to \code{0.001}.}

\item{early.threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 that defines the portion of the dataset considered as the early / pre-deployment phase.
Rows falling within the first early.threshold * 100\% of the dataset are classified as part of this phase.
Anomalies detected in this range will result in the removal of all earlier rows. The default value is 0.2 (20\%).}

\item{late.threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 that defines the portion of the dataset considered as the late / post-deployment phase.
Rows falling within the last (1 - late.threshold) * 100\% of the dataset are classified as part of this phase.
Anomalies detected in this range will result in the removal of all subsequent rows. The default value is 0.8 (80\%).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, the function will print detailed processing
information. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame (\code{data}) with rows before or after the detected temporal discontinuities removed.
}
\description{
This function identifies and handles temporal discontinuities in a specified datetime column of a dataset.
It determines the expected sampling interval by calculating the most frequent time difference
between consecutive timestamps. Any detected gaps larger than this interval are flagged as anomalies.
}
\details{
Rows corresponding to these anomalies are removed based on their position relative to
two customizable thresholds:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Early data period:} If anomalies occur within the first early.threshold\% of the dataset,
all rows before the last anomaly in this range are discarded.
\item \strong{Late data period:} If anomalies occur within the last late.threshold\% of the dataset,
all rows after the first anomaly in this range are discarded.
}

Anomalies detected within the central portion of the dataset, outside these thresholds, will not result in
any rows being removed. Instead, a warning is issued to alert the user to potential data irregularities
requiring manual inspection.
