\title{Identify and Handle Vertical Displacement Speed Outliers in Time Series Data}
\usage{
checkVerticalSpeed(
  data,
  id.col = "ID",
  depth.col = "depth",
  vertical.speed.threshold,
  sampling.rate,
  pre.deploy.threshold = 0.2,
  post.deploy.threshold = 0.8,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or data table containing depth data (from a single animal).}

\item{id.col}{A string representing the column name for the ID field (default is "ID").}

\item{depth.col}{A character string specifying the name of the column containing the depth values. Default is \code{"depth"}.}

\item{vertical.speed.threshold}{A numeric value specifying the threshold for vertical speed outliers (in m/s).}

\item{sampling.rate}{The sampling rate for the data (in Hz), used to adjust the vertical speed calculation. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{pre.deploy.threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1, indicating the threshold (as a percentage) for the start of the deployment period.}

\item{post.deploy.threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1, indicating the threshold (as a percentage) for the end of the deployment period.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, the function will print detailed processing information. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame (\code{data}) with rows containing vertical speed outliers removed.
}
\description{
This function checks for vertical displacement speed outliers in the data, where vertical speed
is calculated as the absolute difference in depth between consecutive measurements, adjusted for
the sampling rate. Spurious data points with vertical speeds exceeding a user-specified threshold
are flagged, and rows with these outliers are removed based on their position relative to the
defined pre-deployment and post-deployment periods.
